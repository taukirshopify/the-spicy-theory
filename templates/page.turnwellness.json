Our mind directly affects our body, and persistent stressful events trigger our \"fight or flight\" response.<br\/><br\/>This can lead to hormonal imbalances, anxiety and depression, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, chronic muscular pain and much more. Recognizing negative stress triggers and identifying proper coping mechanisms will restore a sense of balance.
